# kurt-roger-bridge-bidding

This is a page about the bridge bidding I and my bridge parner Roger uses.

[mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is used to generate the documentation.

Thus the doc is written in markdown.
I have made a preprocessor so I can edit the suit colors.

The doc is also written in swedish!
So this repo have limited usage for non swedish people

The resulting html/css/javascript doc can be viewed at: https://kurteklund.github.io/kurt-roger-bridge-bidding/
