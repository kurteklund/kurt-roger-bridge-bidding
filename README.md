# kurt-roger-bridge-bidding

This is a page about the bridge bidding I and my bridge parner Roger uses.

[mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is used to generate the documentation.

Thus the doc is written in markdown.
I have made a preprocessor so I can edit the suit colors as

!s => spade\
!h => heart\
!d => dimond\
!c => club\

The doc is also written in swedish!
So this repo have limited usage for non swedish people
